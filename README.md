Trying to learn more about Data Science.

I graduated within the past two years with a BS in Information Technology. I just moved to NC to start a career as a Business Analyst and am looking to gain more analytical skills. I also want to find out more about Data Science as I think it may interest me and be a good/easy career change from a BA somewhere down the line. I am always open to learning new things especially technologies that may help advance my career and am definately open to going back to school for a graduate degree at some point.
